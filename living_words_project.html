    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Because I wrote it and am aware of its origins, I can rotate it as I like when I write it the way I want to. 
        What use is it for me to write about something that AI can instantly make better or worse when it already writes about what the world agrees to hear or what the filter is set to allow you to hear? 
        Why must I stick to the topic that deals with mending a situation when it is incorrect if the source of the problem is not addressed first?

    <h2>Understanding Depression in Career Development</h2>
    <p>
        I believe. Sincerely, I am unable to articulate the concept of "challenging depression or managing it in career development." 
        However, I do have a passion for making our lives easier, which, in turn, I think, organically handles depression in professional development.
    </p>
    <p>
        Depression is a type of economic deterioration that occurs when people are pressured to meet the expectations of others without first knowing the facts.
    </p>
    <p>
        The root of the issue is like the teeth; if the root is bad, then the teeth will rot and fall out. 
        If we do not take care of the teeth, then the dry mouth is left with a rot that is difficult to heal.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our light is where happiness is, and without it, we tend to care less for the shine, or the teeth at all.
    </p>

        "If you lie, your teeth will fall out."
    </p>
    <p>
        Growing up, the child was exposed to lies and the mind's attempt to create its own truth. 
        Life is left in a world where people would otherwise strive to find the simplest way to escape suffering if they didn't trust their surroundings.
    </p>
    <p>
        The child later claimed to have washed their teeth, even though they hadn't.
    </p>
    <p>
        Normally, we can't say that everything can solve the impassé. 
        But when speaking "With a Strong Heart," we may use anything of everything, fishing right... into an automorphic moonshot.
